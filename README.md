# Material Balance in Wet-Gas Reservoir

## A wet-gas reservoir was discovered at an initial pressure of 8800 psia(60.72 MPa). 5 Bcf of gas (141.7 mln. st. m3) has been produced by the time the pressure declined to 8300 psia(57.27 MPa). Considering volumetric depletion, calculate the OGIP and the produced gas when pressure falls to 6800 psia(46.9 MPa). Use provided PVT properties for wet gas, ignore pore-volume contraction and connate-water expansion. 

PVT properties for wet gas.

# Material Balance in a Black-Oil Reservoir 

## A black-oil reservoir was depleted from an initial pressure of 2000 psia to 1000 psia. The reservoir has produced 40.5 MMSTB of oil and 58 Bcf of gas. The fluid's bubblepoint pressure is 1680 psia. Calculate OOIP and OGIP using provided PVT data for black oil.
